<h1 style="color:red;">Legends of Holi</h1>
<p style="font-size:19px">Legends of Holi are as colourful as Holi itself. There are myriad shades and tones in them from the subtle ones of love and devotion to the darker hues pertaining to demons and their devilish desires.

What is remarkable is the faith of millions of Hindus in these legends. They relive these stories every year and bring to life the incidents which occurred (or might not have occurred) thousands of years ago.

A belief in the legends, devotion to god and a strong belief in the fact that it is the good and the truth that ultimately prevails over the evil pulls the people to religiously follow the set traditions each year.

And, this faith - in god and the ancient traditions is what still binds the people in a spirit of love and harmony in this otherwise divided society. </p><br>
