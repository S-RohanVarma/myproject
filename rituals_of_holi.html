<h1 style="color:red;">Rituals of Holi </h1>
<p style="font-size:19px">Rituals of the ancient festival of Holi are religiously followed every year with care and enthusiasm. </p>
<h1 style="color:red;">Preparations</h1>
<p style="font-size:19px">Days before the festival people start gathering wood for the lighting of the bonfire called Holika at the major crossroads of the city. This ensures that at the time of the actual celebration a huge pile of wood is collected. </p>
<p style="font-size:19px">hen on the eve of Holi, Holika Dahan takes place. Effigy of Holika, the devil minded sister of demon King Hiranyakashyap is placed in the wood and burnt. For, Holika tried to kill Hiranyakashyap's son Prahlad, an ardent devotee of Lord Naarayana. The ritual symbolises the victory of good over evil and also the triumph of a true devotee.

Children also hurl abuses at Holika and pray pranks, as if they still try to chase away Dhundhi who once troubled little ones in the Kingdom of Prithu. Some people also take embers from the fire to their homes to rekindle their own domestic fires. </p><br>
