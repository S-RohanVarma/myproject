<p style="font-size:19px">Holi is an ancient festival of India and was originally known as 'Holika'.
 The festivals finds a detailed description in early religious works such as Jaimini's Purvamimamsa-Sutras and Kathaka-Grhya-Sutras.
 Historians also believe that Holi was celebrated by all Aryans but more so in the Eastern part of India.</p>

Earlier it was a special rite performed by married women for the happiness and well-being of their families and the full moon (Raka) was worshiped. </p>
